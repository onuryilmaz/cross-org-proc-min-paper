\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

In this section, studies related to the work presented in this thesis are summarized. Firstly, studies in the process mining area are explained and then studies from cross-organizational process mining, which is the main topic of this research, is introduced. Following these, studies related to similarity in process mining is mentioned. Finally, performance and conformance analysis approaches in process mining area are presented.

 Within the process mining framework, there are various different process mining algorithms proposed which have the same aim of discovering underlying processes. Considering the underlying approaches undertaken, algorithms can be grouped as $\alpha$-algorithms \cite{van2004workflow,de2004process}, inductive approaches \cite{herbst1998integrating, herbst2000dealing}, hierarchical clustering \cite{greco2005mining}, genetic approaches \cite{van2005genetic,esgin2010hybrid}, and heuristic approaches \cite{esgin2009hybrid}. Considering the scope of this study; process discovery operations are undertaken with inductive methods which is a robust, repeatable and mature set of approaches.
